    "# Load A/C & Ventilation Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We scraped the following link for downloadable Excel files for both A/C and ventilation data: https://www.nycenet.edu/roomassessment?code=M001. Then we consolidated those downloaded Excel files into a single CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the IBO \"barriers to schools\" report uses a different A/C dataset from a report made for City Council by DOE. Find it on [this page](https://council.nyc.gov/budget/fy2021/) for the 2021 City Council budget under the \"Terms and Conditions\" section in the hyperlink for \"Department of Education – Air Conditioning Report (1 of 2) (XLSX)\". This data only exists for FY2021 and prior. Theoretically, the data we pulled above is more recent, but the catch is that the DOE AC report to city council was wrapped up a little better (i.e. it had already done the math of sqft with A/C by building code) and had extra stats like cost estimated for remaining A/C buildout.\n",
    "\n",
    "I explored joining our A/C data onto the [buildings space data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-Building-Space-Usage/wavz-fkw8/about_data) from Open Data NYC to get a pct area figure of square feet covered by A/C. But that is proving to be messy because the joins don't work very cleanly. So, instead I am going to just do a proportion of regular classrooms with A/C. That follows the methodology from DOE's reports on A/C to City Council, where they focused on instructional rooms rather than gyms, auditoriums, cafeterias, libraries, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the main metric we'll put in the dashboard is proportion of classrooms with A/C, but I want to add in to that data the proportion of all the other room types so that we can see when a building is truly 100% and when it's not. Also it matters if the gym doesn't have A/C."
